# Etch-a-Sketch
This is a browser-based version of the classic toy the Etch-a-Sketch. It was created using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this project was to practice manipulating the DOM of web pages.

When pressing one of the options, a prompt asking for input will be shown. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before so that youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad. 

The maximum number that a user can input into the grid is 100. 

The 'Black and White' button simply changes the squares from black to white. The 'Random Colors' option changes the squares to random colors, and the 'Gradual Color Change' option adds 10% of the color black to each square hovered over.
